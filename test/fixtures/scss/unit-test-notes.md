- catch parsing errors
- unfortunately need to mock up some fake data

- catch ad configuration errors
  - need to make sure the ad config doesn't disappear

- please don't write new tests using jasmine spec runner
  - easier to use node for tests (both teamcity and command-line)
  - use mocha and if you need to launch in the browser use mocha with karma


- eventually test more things like browser


side notes:
- please please check all your IDEs for indentation rules.


- mocha and chai have easier documentation to read
- jest has some downsides
